# **Version 1.0.1**

Hey everyone! This update includes some minor fixes in preparation for Quill's release. More specifically, it adds haptic feedback throughout the app, fixes a bug with the sheet not dismissing upon purchasing Quill+, and small changes to the App Store product page. I hope you enjoy the app and feel free to reach out with any feedback you may have!

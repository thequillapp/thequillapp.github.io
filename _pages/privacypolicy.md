If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

- Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.

- Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.

  - Analyze how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users

- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin

- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse

- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province

- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
